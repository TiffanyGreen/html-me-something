    <p>Floating, or Sensory Deprivation, is the practice of allowing your mind and body 
        to rest in a low-sensory environment. You lay in what is essentially a big bathtub 
        that has around 1,000&nbsp;lbs of epsom salt dissolved into 10.5&nbsp;inches of water. When you
        lay in that salty-water solution, your body immediately floats to the surface, supported 
        in every way. The water sits at a temperature where your skin doesn't recognize heat (93.5&nbsp;degrees).
        It's completely dark, and completely silent.  What your body and mind can do to rejuvenate 
        in 90&nbsp;minutes of "sensory deprivation" is truly incredible.  </P>

    <h4><b>Benefits of Floating</b></h4>

        <p>Floating is known to have MANY benefits. Most noteworthy are: increased focus, expanded creativity, reduction of 
        muscle soreness, migraine and tenion headache relief, stress reduction, greater sense of 
        well-being, athletic recovery.</p>

    <h4>Let's talk practicality: How to Float</h4>
        <p>There are two different types of devices: a pod and a room.  The pod is 4&nbsp;by&nbsp;8&nbsp;feet, and an oval shape.
            It has a lid that closes over it like a clam-shell.  The room is bigger.  It's a 6.5&nbsp;by&nbsp;8.5&nbsp;feet rectangle 
            (bigger than a king-sized bed!). Both devices function the exact same - they're just different shapes and sizes.</p>
        
        <p>Each device is in a private room with a private shower.  The door to the room locks; the door to the device doesn't and you have 
            full control over opening and closing it. You can leave the door ajar if you'd like. </p>

        <p>The process is super simple: you shower, you float, then you shower again</p>

    <h4><b>My Float Experiences</b></h4>

        <p>The environment is just that: an environment. It is space.  It's space to think.  Space to relax - and truly relax. It's space to parse 
        through the inner workings of your mind, your experience, your past, and how to move forward.</p>
    
        <p>No two floats are the same.</p>

        <p>I've had floats where I'll zone out, somewhere in that space between conscious and unconscious. 
            I've also had floats where I'll just sleep for an hour or two and wake up with the music. </p>

        <p>I occasionally will caffeinate beforehand and work through ideas, moving into a more creative and productive mode.</p>
